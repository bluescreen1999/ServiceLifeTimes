# .NET Core Service Lifetimes

### Differents service lifetimes in .NET Core:
#### âœ…Transient
#### âœ…Scoped
#### âœ…Singleton.

## Project Structure
- `ITransientDateTimeService`, `IScopedDateTimeService`, `ISingletonDateTimeService`: Interfaces for the different service lifetimes.
- `DateTimeService`: Implements the above interfaces. This service simply provides the current UTC date and time.
- `ApplicationLogger`: A class that uses the services to log the current date and time.
- `LifeTimesController`: A controller that also uses the services and logs the current date and time.

## Usage:

- **Ensure you have the .NET 8 SDK installed.**

- **Run the application using `dotnet run` command.**

- Call the only API that exists in this project with `/lifetimes` URL multiple times.

âš  **Pay attention to the console output**, as it provides information about the **service lifetimes** and when certain events occur.

âš  Console messages in different colors represent the **beginning** and **end** of a **request**, as well as service instantiation timestamps.

ðŸŸ¡The `transient` service gives a `new instance` for `each request`.

ðŸ”µThe `scoped` service gives the `same instance` within `a request` but different instances across requests.

ðŸ”´The `singleton` service gives the `same instance` across `all requests`.
