# .NET Core Service Lifetimes

## Usage:

- **Ensure you have the .NET 8 SDK installed.**

- **Run the application using `dotnet run` command.**

- Call the `/lifetimes` API multiple times.

---

âš  **Pay attention to the console output**, as it provides information about the **service lifetimes** and when certain events occur.

âš  Console messages in different colors represent the **beginning** and **end** of a **request**, as well as service instantiation timestamps.

**While there may be some mistakes or less-than-optimal practices in the code, please feel at ease. Remember, this is just a simple sample ðŸ™ƒ**
